# shadow-generations-saves
***Saves for Shadow Generations run practice.***

### Summary:
- The name of the folders indicate the point at the game where the save is, e.g. the folder named "SH2" contains a save just after completing Sunset Heights Act 2.
- These saves have no collection keys, collection items, or screws collected.
- All levels are S ranked.
- These saves follow the current (29/11/24) any% route, the only significant effect this has is that SCA1 challenges aren't completed until after Doom Morph is obtained.

### How to download:
- Download the .zip file from the most recent release, and unzip it

**OR**

- Clone this repo

### How to use on Windows:
- **Back up all existing saves before doing this!**
- Find the file named "gamedata.sav" from the folder with the save location you want to use.
- To insert the save into slot 1, place the file into "%AppData%\SEGA\SONIC_X_SHADOW_GENERATIONS\steam\ [STEAM ID]\game0".
- To insert the save into slot 2, place the file into "%AppData%\SEGA\SONIC_X_SHADOW_GENERATIONS\steam\ [STEAM ID]\game1"
- To insert the save into slot 3, place the file into "%AppData%\SEGA\SONIC_X_SHADOW_GENERATIONS\steam\ [STEAM ID]\game2"
- (ignore the space before [STEAM ID] markdown doesn't like having \ right next to [ )
- The folders for the save slots won't exist if the slot has never been used before (e.g. "game2" will not exist if slot 3 has never been used), so you may have to create them yourself.
